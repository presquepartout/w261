    "2. Conquer by recursively sorting the subarrays in each of the two subproblems created by the divide step. That is, recursively sort the subarray array[p..q] and recursively sort the subarray array[q+1..r].\n",

    "One example of the use of combiner is in the basic Word Count problem.  The mapper will emit a < word, count > pair for every word encountered in the input.  Running a combiner will merge all the records which have the same words into a single record.  This greatly reduce the size of the data which Hadoop needs to shuffle and sort.\n",
