    "Use Counters to do EDA (exploratory data analysis and to monitor progress)\n",
    "Counters are lightweight objects in Hadoop that allow you to keep track of system progress in both the map and reduce stages of processing. By default, Hadoop defines a number of standard counters in \"groups\"; these show up in the jobtracker webapp, giving you information such as \"Map input records\", \"Map output records\", etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "While processing information/data using MapReduce job, it is a challenge to monitor the progress of parallel threads running across nodes of distributed clusters. Moreover, it is also complicated to distinguish between the data that has been processed and the data which is yet to be processed. The MapReduce Framework offers a provision of user-defined Counters, which can be effectively utilized to monitor the progress of data across nodes of distributed clusters.\n",

    "\n",
    "The consumer complaints dataset consists of diverse consumer complaints, which have been reported across the United States regarding various types of loans. The dataset consists of records of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complaint ID,Product,Sub-product,Issue,Sub-issue,State,ZIP code,Submitted via,Date received,Date sent to company,Company,Company response,Timely response?,Consumer disputed?\n",

    "User-defined Counters\n",

    "Now, letâ€™s use Hadoop Counters to identify the number of complaints pertaining to debt collection, mortgage and other categories (all other categories get lumped into this one) in the consumer complaints dataset. Basically produce the distribution of the Product column in this dataset using counters (limited to 3 counters here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hadoop offers Job Tracker, an UI tool to determine the status and statistics of all jobs. Using the job tracker UI, developers can view the Counters that have been created. Screenshot your  job tracker UI as your job completes and include it here. Make sure that your user defined counters are visible. "
